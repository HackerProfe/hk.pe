## How to contribute your article?
Our website is open source on Github, so all you need to do is fork our repository, create your article, and submit a Pull Request.

## I won't
It doesn't matter, next I will teach you step by step if you contribute your own article.

### Step 1
You need to fork our repo
- Github: https://github.com/HackerProfe/hk.pe
### Step 2
Clone it to your local computer
```shell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/hk.pe
```
### Step 3
If you're not familiar with Hexo or you need to run npm install, wait a while and you'll be able to use Hexo CLI to create your article
```shell
hexo new post `YOUR-ARTICLE-NAME`
```
### Step 4
I guess this step will be simple, you just need to use "markdown" to write your article

### Step 5
When you're done with your article, push it to your repository and you should make a pull request.

###
Just wait for us to merge the repositories, it's that simple!
